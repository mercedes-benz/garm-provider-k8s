## âœ¨ What is the `garm-provider-k8s`?

`garm-provider-k8s` is a [KubernetesÂ®](https://kubernetes.io) a plugin for [garm](https://github.com/cloudbase/garm) which enables garm to spin up Pod based [GitHubÂ® Action runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) on a Kubernetes cluster.

## ðŸ”€ Versioning

### Kubernetes Version

`garm-provider-k8s` uses [`client-go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to talk with
Kubernetes clusters. The supported Kubernetes cluster version is determined by `client-go`.
The compatibility matrix for client-go and Kubernetes cluster can be found
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix).

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. A Kubernetes cluster to spin up runners with the `garm-provider-k8s` plugin.
2. A working `garm` installation.

### Installation

#### `garm-provider-k8s`

We are releasing the `garm-provider-k8s` as a simple go binary. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/garm-provider-k8s/releases).
Adjust your existing `garm` config, so garm can register to provider plugin at runtime. Make sure garm has access to the binary and provider specific config path like so:

```toml
[[provider]]
name = "kubernetes_external"
description = "kubernetes provider"
provider_type = "external"
[provider.external]
config_file = "/path/to/garm-provider-k8s-config.yaml"
provider_executable = "/path/to/provider/binary/garm-provider-k8s"
environment_variables = ["KUBERNETES_"] # this must be set if the runner-pods should run in the same cluster as garm itself is running and the attached serviceaccount should be used to create pods and the runner namespace
```

The provider specific config file should look like this:
```yaml
kubeConfigPath: "" # path to a kubernetes config file - if empty the in cluster config will be used
runnerNamespace: "runner" # namespace to create the runner pods in
podTemplate: # pod template to use for the runner pods / helpful to add sidecar containers
  spec:
    volumes:
      - name: my-additional-volume
        emptyDir: {}
flavors: # configure different flavors which will be set as `ResourceRequirements` at runner container and can be targeted from a pool via its `flavor` property
