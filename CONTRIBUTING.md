## Quality
Please ensure that for all contributions, the corresponding documentation is in-sync and up-to-date. All documentation should be in English language.

We assume that for every non-trivial contribution, the project has been built and tested prior to the contribution.

### Validate and test your code

Before you commit your code, please make sure that it is valid and tested. The existing tests can be run with `make test` and should give you a rough idea if your code changed any current behavior.

In [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) we also run some checks on your code, but you can also run them locally
before you push by running

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# run the tests
make test
# lint the code
make lint
# verify if any code-generator hasn't run
make verify
```
